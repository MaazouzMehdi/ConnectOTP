# ConnectOTP
This project aims to show you how to connect OpenTripPlanner and MobilityDB and to display the generated trips on Qgis. The generated trips are multi-modal and focus on means of transport obtained via GTFS data.

Requirements
------------

*   Linux (other UNIX-like systems may work, but remain untested)
*   Java >= 11
*   PostgreSQL >= 10
*   PostGIS >= 2.5
*	Python >= 3.0
	* As well as a compatible version of pip 
*   MobilityDB 1.0
*   JSON-C
*   QGis 3.22 Białowieża and its two modules
	* Move ( https://github.com/mschoema/move )

You will find a WorkShop explaining the different steps


Overview
-----------------------
Here you can see an overview of several routes generated by the OpenTripPlanner API and converted into MobilityDB format. This format allows us to visualize temporal points moving over time
