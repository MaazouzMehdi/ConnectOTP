# ConnectOTP
This project aims to show you how to connect OpenTripPlanner and MobilityDB and to display the generated trips on Qgis. The generated trips are multi-modal and focus on means of transport obtained via GTFS data.

*   Linux (other UNIX-like systems may work, but remain untested)
*   Java >= 11
*   PostgreSQL >= 10

Overview
-----------------------
Here you can see an overview of several routes generated by the OpenTripPlanner API and converted into MobilityDB format. This format allows us to visualize temporal points moving over time
