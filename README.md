# ConnectOTP
This project aims to show you how to connect OpenTripPlanner and MobilityDB and to display the generated trips on Qgis. The generated trips are multi-modal and focus on means of transport obtained via GTFS data.

Requirements
------------

*   Linux (other UNIX-like systems may work, but remain untested)
*   Java >= 11
*   PostgreSQL >= 11
*   PostGIS >= 2.5
*	Python >= 3.0
	* As well as a compatible version of pip 
*   MobilityDB 1.0 ( or dev branch )
*   JSON-C
*   QGis 3.22 Białowieża and one of its module
	* Move ( https://github.com/mschoema/move )

Optional Dependencies
-----------------------
Dependencies needed for user's documentation :

* The DocBook DTD and XSL files are required for building the documentation. For Ubuntu, they are provided by the packages
`docbook` and `docbook-xsl`.
* The XML validator xmllint is required for validating the XML files of the documentation. For Ubuntu, it is provided by the
package `libxml2`.
* The XSLT processor xsltproc is required for building the documentation in HTML format. For Ubuntu, it is provided by
the package `libxslt`.
* The program dblatex is required for building the documentation in PDF format. For Ubuntu, it is provided by the package
`dblatex`.



Status
-----------------------
This project is currently under development. We are planning to release the first version this summer.


Issues 
-----------------------
Please report any [issues](https://github.com/MaazouzMehdi/ConnectOTP/issues) you may have.


Documentation
-------------

### Tutorial

You can generate the tutorial in HTML as well as PDF format. The tutorial is generated in English ( currently working to generate the manual in French as well). For this, you have to run `make_doc.sh` with appropriate options in the cmake command as follows:

*   `-html`: Generate in HTML format
*   `-pdf`: Generate in PDF format

For example, the following command generates the documentation in HTML format.
```bash
bash make_doc.sh -html
```
Note that this file is at the root of the project. Moreover you may need to use `sudo` if `make_doc.sh` causes errors.
The resulting documentation will be generated in the `doc` directory.

In addition, pregenerated version of PDF format is available :

*   [PDF](https://github.com/MaazouzMehdi/ConnectOTP/tree/main/workshop/pdf/connect-workshop.pdf)


Overview
-----------------------
Here you can see an overview of several trips generated by the OpenTripPlanner API and converted into MobilityDB format. This format allows us to visualize temporal points moving over time.

Here you can see a person walking from point A to point B while a second person makes the same journey, at the same time, by public transport

Here you can see a lot of people making trip in Brussels.

Benchmark
-----------------------

This section is intended to show the maximum number of requests that can be processed per hour. 
This gives us an idea of the scalability of our application.

### Machine used

*  Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 
*  SSD 512 Go 
*  8Go RAM 
*  Intel Core i5-5300U CPU running at 2.30GHz (2 physical cores and 2 logical cores)

### Test 1

For this test, we used OSM data from Brussels and GTFS data from the STIB. Here are the results :

*  Graph building took 1.3 minutes
*  The graph build contains : |V| = 139519
*  The graph build contains |E| = 367902 
*  1 Go was necessery to create the graph

![trips_white](https://github.com/MaazouzMehdi/ConnectOTP/blob/main/images/benchmark1.jpg)

We use multi-trheading to reach more than 27 700 requests per hour which corresponds to 462 queries per minute.
However an user using this application would be limited to Brussels city and a trip composed exclusively of 2 modalities (STIB agency and the walging).

### Test 2

We created a bounding box allowing us to enlarge our OSM data by taking Brussels and its periphery.
We increase our modalities up by 1 (we've got STIB angecy, De Lijn agency and the walking). Here are the results :

*  Graph building took 4.8 minutes
*  The graph build contains : |V| = 232752
*  The graph build contains |E| = 514152 
*  4 Go was necessery to create the graph

![trips_white](https://github.com/MaazouzMehdi/ConnectOTP/blob/main/images/benchmark2.jpg)

Since the graph is larger (|V| increased by 66 % and |E| incresead by 40 %) and more modalities are available, the average
number of queries executed per hour decreases significantly compared to our first test. Our application reach 11965 queries per
hour which corresponds to 200 queries per minute. We observe a 46% reduction in the number of average requests executed by
the application in a given time
